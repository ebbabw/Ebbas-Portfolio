# Ebbas-Portfolio
Week 8 - Technigo Course 

Started creating a portfolio.

I had some issues I need to check before pushing this live later on. 

But I happy with the mobile version and rest is little bit messy. 

I think I didn't have a good time management on the project, I'm not happy with that and need to work more on that
